## Description

Ann sent the files and she said she thought we were going to meet about it.  I gently reminded her that I'd asked a few times about it and asked her to send it so we can review and estimate it....lol

Dropping in the Trello board for review and then we can estimates the changes out.

Let's see if we can knock that out on Monday in our internal call and I'll send over the final estimates list to Ann.
